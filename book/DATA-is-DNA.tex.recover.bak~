\chapter{The Nature of Data}
\section{What is Data}
The term 'data' originates from the Latin word *datum*, meaning "something given." Over time, the word has evolved to encompass various definitions, depending on the context in which it is used. In general, data refers to information or facts that can be used for analysis, reasoning, or computation. Below are some well-recognized definitions from different perspectives:\\
\subsection{Definitions of Data}
\subsubsection{Linguistic Origins and Basic Definitions}
According to Webster's Third New International Dictionary, data is "something given or admitted; facts or principles granted or presented; that upon which an inference or argument is based, or from which an ideal system of any sort is constructed." This definition emphasizes the foundational nature of data, implying that data is the starting point for any logical process, whether in science, philosophy, or everyday reasoning.\\\\
Similarly, the Oxford Encyclopaedic English Dictionary defines data as "known facts or things used as a basis for inference or reckoning." This stresses the use of data as input for making judgments, calculations, or conclusions.\\\\
Though 'data' is the plural form of 'datum', it is commonly treated as a singular noun in modern language. While the plural form is technically correct, the singular usage is widely accepted. For consistency in this book, 'data' will be treated as a plural noun, referring to multiple pieces of information or facts.\\
\subsubsection{Definitions from Various Disciplines}

Different fields and organizations have their own definitions of data:

\paragraph{UNESCO's Definition:} 
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines data as "facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human or automatic means." This highlights that data must be structured or organized to be useful, especially in the context of computer systems where data is processed and transferred.\\
\paragraph{Commerce Perspective:}
Robert A. Arnold, in his work *Modern Data Processing*, provides a definition of data in the context of business and accounting, focusing on its role in the management and processing of information relevant to business functions.\\
\paragraph{Economics Perspective:}
The *Dictionary of Modern Economics* describes data as "observations on the numerical magnitude of economic phenomena such as national income, unemployment, or the retail price." In economics, data usually refers to quantifiable measurements or observations that are used to analyze economic trends and make informed decisions.\\
\paragraph{Scientific Definition:}
In the sciences, data is often described as a set of "numerical or qualitative values derived from scientific experiments." According to the *McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology*, this data is the result of observation and experimentation, and it forms the basis of scientific knowledge.\\
\paragraph{CODATA's Definition:}
The Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) defines data as the "crystallized presentation of the essence of scientific knowledge in the most accurate form." This implies that scientific data is a refined and exact representation of reality, critical for making advancements in scientific research.\\
\paragraph{Social Sciences Definition:}
In social sciences, data is defined as values or facts, often accompanied by study designs, code books, and research reports, which are used by researchers for secondary analysis. In fields such as sociology and political science, data can be qualitative (like interviews and surveys) or quantitative (like public opinion polls).\\
\paragraph{Humanities Definition:}
In the humanities, data often takes the form of text, such as Biblical materials or Shakespearean drama. The finite amount of text represents a fixed quantity of data, which scholars interpret. However, interpretations can vary widely due to differing viewpoints, even though the text itself remains unchanged. In this sense, humanities data is more subjective and open to different perspectives.\\
\paragraph{Information Science Definition:}
In information science, Shuman (1975) defines data as "quantitative facts derived from experimentation, calculation, or direct observation." Shuman further explains that a more meaningful definition of data is "the symbolization of knowledge," meaning that data represents a raw form of knowledge that must be processed and interpreted to extract meaning.\\
\subsection{Attributes of Data}
Data, regardless of the field it comes from, shares several core attributes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Clarity and Accuracy:} As noted in the CODATA definition, scientific data must be both clear and accurate, meaning it should be easily understandable and precisely represent the phenomenon being measured.
	\item \textbf{Relevance and Arrangement:} Data is only useful when it is relevant to a particular context. It must be organized or structured in a way that allows it to be processed or interpreted effectively.\\
	\item \textbf{Quantitative vs. Qualitative:} Data can be either numerical (quantitative) or descriptive (qualitative). While numerical data allows for more precise analysis, qualitative data often provides deeper insights into complex issues.\\
	\item \textbf{Expanding Nature of Scientific Data:} In sciences, data is not fixed and is continuously expanding as scientists make new observations and use instruments to generate more systematic data.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Contextual Use of Data}
\subsubsection{Data in Different Domains}
\paragraph{Sciences:} In scientific research, data is often collected through observation and experimentation. Scientists use instruments and measurement tools to record quantitative or qualitative values. As scientific knowledge grows, so does the body of available data.\\
\paragraph{Social Sciences:} In fields such as sociology, economics, and political science, data may include survey results, statistical figures, or observations from field research. Researchers use this data to analyze societal trends and test hypotheses.\\
\paragraph{Humanities:} In disciplines like literature, history, and philosophy, data might consist of texts, documents, or artifacts. The analysis of this data typically involves interpretation and critical thinking, as opposed to statistical analysis.\\
\subsubsection{Symbolization of Knowledge}
Data, in its raw form, lacks meaning until it is processed and interpreted. In information science, the term "symbolization of knowledge" refers to how data must be contextualized and understood within a specific framework to gain relevance and coherence. This is particularly true in fields where data is used to draw conclusions or make predictions.\\
\subsection{The Expanding Role of Data}
In the modern digital era, data is expanding at an unprecedented rate due to advancements in technology, including the proliferation of internet usage, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics. As a result, data has become a valuable resource for decision-making, innovation, and economic development.

\section{Theoretical Foundations of Data}

\subsection{Data in Information Theory}
\subsubsection{What is  Information Theory}
In 1948, Claude Shannon published a paper called *A Mathematical Theory of Communication* , which marked a significant turning point in our understanding of information. Before Shannon’s paper, information had been regarded as an abstract, somewhat undefined concept a kind of miasmic fluid without a clear structure. However, after Shannon's work, it became evident that information could be quantified and measured in a precise way. Shannon’s key contribution was to demonstrate that information, much like physical quantities such as mass or energy, could be treated systematically and mathematically. This led to the establishment of a rigorous, measurable understanding of information.\vspace{0.5cm}\\
According to \textit{Merriam-Webster} (merriam-webster.com), “Information is any entity or form that provides the answer to a question of some kind or resolves uncertainty.” This definition illustrates the relationship between data, information, and knowledge: data refers to raw values or facts attributed to parameters, while knowledge represents a deeper understanding of real-world phenomena or abstract concepts. Information, then, lies between these two—transforming data into something meaningful by resolving uncertainty or answering questions. However, modern Information Theory does not concern itself directly with these abstract relationships between data, information, and knowledge. Instead, it provides a mathematical framework for modeling and analyzing the transmission and processing of information, especially in communication systems..\vspace{0.5cm}\\
The foundation of Information Theory can be traced back to Claude E. Shannon's groundbreaking article, *A Mathematical Theory of Communication*, published in the *Bell System Technical Journal* in 1948. Shannon's work laid the groundwork for understanding how messages can be accurately transmitted over noisy communication channels. In this seminal paper, Shannon introduced the concept of encoding messages to protect them from noise and distortions during transmission. The core problem Shannon tackled was how to reproduce a message accurately at a receiving end, given the uncertainties introduced by the transmission medium. As Shannon stated in the introduction of his article:\\
\begin{quote}
	“The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning. . . . These semantic aspects of communications are irrelevant to the engineering problem. . . . The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.”
\end{quote}
In 1964, Shannon, along with Warren Weaver, published a book titled “The Mathematical Theory of Communication,” which further emphasized the general applicability of his theories beyond just communication systems. This work solidified the importance of Information Theory in understanding various phenomena in multiple disciplines.\\
Information Theory provides essential methods and analytical tools for designing effective communication systems. Figure \ref{fig:1.1} illustrates the basic components of a communication system, highlighting the key elements involved in the process of transmitting information:\\

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./1.1.png}
	\caption{The general model of a communication system.}
	\label{fig:1.1}
	\textbf{Components:}
\end{figure}
\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Source}: This is where the information originates. It can be any type of data, such as text, audio, or video. For instance, a text document or a video file could serve as the source.
	\item \textbf{Source Encoder}: The source encoder transforms the information from the source into a suitable format for transmission. This may involve compressing the data to reduce its size, making it more efficient to send. For example, a text file might be compressed into a smaller file format like ZIP.
	\item \textbf{Channel Encoder}: This component adds redundancy to the encoded message to protect against errors that may occur during transmission. The redundancy helps the system detect and correct errors. For example, adding parity bits to the data stream can help identify if any bits were altered during transmission.
	\item \textbf{Channel}: The channel is the medium through which the encoded message travels. It can be a physical medium like copper wires or fiber optics, or a wireless medium such as radio waves.
	\item \textbf{Random Noise}:  Noise represents unwanted disturbances that can interfere with the transmitted signal. This could be caused by electrical interference, weather conditions, or other environmental factors. 
	\item \textbf{Channel Decoder}:  This component attempts to correct any errors that occurred during transmission by using the redundancy added by the channel encoder. For instance, it checks the parity bits and makes corrections if discrepancies are found.
	\item \textbf{Demodulator}: The demodulator converts the modulated signal back into its original format after it has traveled through the channel. For example, it might convert a radio signal back into a digital signal.
	\item \textbf{Analog Channel}:  In some systems, the channel might be an analog medium, which requires modulation to convert the digital signals into an analog format suitable for transmission.
	\item \textbf{Channel Estimation}: This process involves estimating the characteristics of the channel to improve the accuracy of the received signal. It helps in adjusting the decoding process based on the estimated conditions of the channel.
	\item \textbf{Source Decoder}:  Finally, the source decoder takes the corrected signal and converts it back into a format that the destination can use, such as a readable text file or a playable audio file.
	\item \textbf{Destination}:  The destination is the final recipient of the transmitted message. This can be a device, user, or system that processes the received information, such as a computer, smartphone, or any device capable of interpreting the data.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Example of Transmitting a Text Message}\\
Let's consider a straightforward example of how a text message is transmitted using the communication system.\\
\textbf{Source}: A user types the message "Hello, World!" on their computer.\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
	\item \textbf{Source}: 
	The original message is: 
	\[\text{Message} = "Hello, World!"\]
	\item \textbf{Source Encoder}: 
	The message is encoded and compressed, resulting in a smaller representation, saved as:
	\[\text{Encoded Message} = \text{Helloworld.txt}\]
	\item \textbf{Channel Encoder}: 
	Redundant data, such as parity bits, are added to the encoded message for error detection. This can be represented as:
	\[	\text{Channel Encoded Message} = \text{Helloworld.txt + Parity Bits}\]
	\item \textbf{Channel}: 
	The encoded message is transmitted through a wireless channel (e.g., Wi-Fi):
	\[\text{Channel} \rightarrow \text{Helloworld.txt + Parity Bits}\]
	\item \textbf{Random Noise}: 
	During transmission, interference introduces noise, causing the message to become distorted:
	\[\text{Received Message} = "Helo, World!" \]
	
	\item \textbf{Channel Decoder}: 
	The receiver uses the redundancy (parity bits) to detect and correct the error:
	\[\text{Corrected Message} = "Hello, World!"\]
	
	\item \textbf{Demodulator}: 
	The received signal is demodulated back into its original digital format.
	
	\item \textbf{Source Decoder}: 
	The corrected message is decoded to restore the original text format:
	\[\text{Final Message} = "Hello, World!"\]
	
	\item \textbf{Destination}: 
	The user receives the corrected message on their computer.
\end{enumerate}
Information theory defines definite, unbreachable limits on precisely how much information can be communicated between any two components of any system, whether this system is man-made or natural. The theorems of information theory are so important that they deserve to be regarded as the laws of information. The basic laws of information can be summarised as follows. For any communication channel (Figure 1): 1) there is a definite upper limit, the channel capacity, to the amount of information that can be communicated through that channel, 2) this limit shrinks as the amount of noise in the channel increases, 3) this limit can very nearly be reached by judicious packaging, or encoding, of data.\\
While the origins of Information Theory are rooted in electrical engineering and telecommunications, its principles have proven invaluable in modeling phenomena across various fields, including physics, mathematics, statistics, computer science, and economics. It cannot simply be regarded as a subset of communication theory; it encompasses a broader scope of applications.\vspace{0.5cm}\\

\subsection{Finding a Route, Bit by Bit}
Information is usually measured in bits, and one bit of information allows you to choose between two equally probable, or \textit{equiprobable}, alternatives. But why is this the case? To better understand this concept, let’s go through a simple example.\\
Imagine you are standing at a fork in the road at point \(A\) in Figure \ref{fig:1.2}, and your goal is to reach point \(D\). Each fork in the road represents two equiprobable alternatives: you can either go left or right. If I tell you to go left, then you have received one bit of information, because this instruction has resolved your uncertainty about which direction to take.\\
We can represent my instruction using a binary digit (bit), where \(0 = \text{left}\) and \(1 = \text{right}\). Therefore, receiving this binary digit gives you exactly one bit of information, which allows you to choose the correct road at the first fork.\\
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./1.2.png}
	\label{fig:1.2}
\end{figure}
\textbf{Figure 2:} \textit{For a traveler who does not know the way, each fork in the road requires one bit of information to make the correct decision. The 0s and 1s on the right-hand side summarize the instructions needed to arrive at each destination. A left turn is indicated by 0, and a right turn by 1.}\\
Now, let’s consider a slightly more complex scenario: after choosing the correct road at point \(A\), you encounter another fork in the road, at point \(B\). Once again, a binary digit (for example, \(1 = \text{right}\)) provides you with one bit of information, allowing you to select the correct road that leads to point \(C\). \\
Notice that, after two decisions, you could have reached any one of four possible interim destinations (points \(C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4\)). The two binary digits you used to make these decisions provided you with two bits of information. These two bits of information allowed you to choose from four equiprobable alternatives. This relationship is given by:\\
\[4 = 2 \times 2 = 2^2\]
\textbf{Expanding the Example}
Now, let’s extend the example even further. After reaching point \(C\), you arrive at a third fork in the road, which requires one more decision. A third binary digit (for example, \(1 = \text{right}\)) provides you with one additional bit of information, allowing you to choose the road that leads to point \(D\). \\
At this point, there are eight different possible routes you could have taken starting from \(A\), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:1.2}. Therefore, the three binary digits you used to make these choices provided you with three bits of information, enabling you to choose from eight equiprobable alternatives. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
\[
8 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^3 = 8
\]
\textbf{Generalizing the Relationship}
We can generalize this concept as follows: let \(n\) represent the number of forks you encounter along the way, and let \(m\) represent the number of possible final destinations. If you encounter \(n\) forks, you are effectively choosing from \(m = 2^n\) final destinations. Since each fork requires one bit of information to make the correct decision, \(n\) forks correspond to \(n\) bits of information.\\
Viewed from another perspective, if there are \(m = 8\) possible destinations, then the number of forks required to reach one of these destinations is \(n = 3\), which corresponds to the logarithm of 8, as expressed in the equation:\\
\[n = \log_2 m\]
Thus, in this case:
\[3 = \log_2 8\]
This equation tells us that three forks (or three bits of information) are required to select one destination out of eight possibilities. More generally, the logarithm of \(m\) is the power to which 2 must be raised to obtain \(m\). In other words:
\[m = 2^n\]
Equivalently, given a number \(m\), which represents the number of final destinations, the number of forks (or bits of information) required is:
\[n = \log_2 m\]
The subscript \(2\) indicates that we are using logarithms to the base 2. This is because, in Information Theory, we typically measure information in terms of binary choices (bits), and logarithms to the base 2 naturally reflect the structure of binary decision-making.\\
\textbf{Additional Examples}
To make this more concrete, consider a few more examples:
\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Two destinations}: If there are only 2 possible destinations, then \(n = \log_2 2 = 1\). This means that only one fork (or one bit of information) is needed to choose the correct path.
		\item \textbf{Sixteen destinations}:  If there are 16 possible destinations, then \(n = \log_2 16 = 4\). Therefore, 4 forks (or 4 bits of information) are required to select the correct destination.
		\item \textbf{Thirty-two destinations}: For 32 possible destinations, \(n = \log_2 32 = 5\). In this case, 5 forks are needed, corresponding to 5 bits of information.
\end{itemize}
These examples illustrate the general rule: the number of forks in the road corresponds directly to the number of bits of information required to navigate through the decision points. The more potential paths you have, the more bits of information are necessary to resolve the uncertainty.\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\textbf{Bits Are Not Binary Digits}\\
The term "bit" originates from the words "binary digit," but it is important to understand that a \textbf{bit} and a \textbf{binary digit} represent different concepts.\\
A \textbf{binary digit} (also known as a \textit{bit value}) is simply the value of a variable in the binary number system. This value can only be one of two possibilities: either 0 or 1. In other words, a binary digit describes a state in a binary system (like whether a light switch is off (0) or on (1)).\\
On the other hand, a \textbf{bit of information} refers to the amount of information conveyed when we distinguish between two equally probable outcomes (0 or 1). A bit measures how much uncertainty is reduced when you learn which of two possible events actually occurred.\\
To illustrate the difference more clearly:\\
- A \textbf{binary digit} tells you the specific state (0 or 1), but the \textbf{bit} measures the \textit{amount of information} you gain by knowing that state.\\
This is where the distinction lies. Confusing a binary digit with a bit is like confusing a physical container with the amount of substance it can hold. For example:\\
- Imagine a pint-sized bottle. The bottle can hold a certain amount of liquid—up to one pint—but it can also be empty or partially filled. The amount of liquid (up to one pint) corresponds to how much it actually holds, while the bottle itself corresponds to the binary digit.\\
Similarly:\\
- A binary digit can take the value of 0 or 1, but the \textit{average} amount of information it conveys can range from zero to one bit, depending on the uncertainty of the outcomes. If the outcome is always certain (e.g., if you know beforehand that it will always be 0), the amount of information gained is zero. However, if both outcomes (0 or 1) are equally likely, learning the value provides one full bit of information.\\
To summarize, the key distinction is:
- A \textbf{binary digit} (0 or 1) represents a possible state or value in a binary system.\\
- A \textbf{bit} represents the \textit{amount of information} you gain by knowing the outcome of a binary decision between two equally likely alternatives.\\

\subsection{Quantifying Data: Bits, Bytes, and Beyond}
\subsubsection{Data Representation}
\textbf{How is Information Represented in a Computer?}  
Information in a computer is represented using \textit{binary digits}, commonly referred to as \textbf{bits}. A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer and can hold a value of either 0 or 1, corresponding to two states: off or on, false or true, low or high voltage. \\
The challenge arises when we need to represent characters, numbers, and other forms of data in a manner that can be easily understood and processed by both the computer and the user. This is where \textbf{character encoding schemes} come into play.
A \textbf{character encoding} scheme is essentially a set of rules that translates characters (such as letters, numbers, and symbols) into a form that the computer can store and process. Some common encoding schemes include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{ASCII} (American Standard Code for Information Interchange): This is a 7-bit code that represents English characters, digits, and some special symbols.
	\item \textbf{EBCDIC} (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code): Another character encoding used primarily in older IBM mainframes.
	\item \textbf{ISCII} (Indian Script Code for Information Interchange): An encoding standard used for Indian scripts.
\end{itemize}
These codes allow computers to represent complex forms of information like text and numbers using combinations of bits.\\\\
\textbf{How are Arithmetic Calculations Performed Through Bits?}\\\\
For performing arithmetic calculations, computers use the binary number system. In this system, all numbers are represented as combinations of 0s and 1s (bits). Binary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) can be performed on these numbers, similar to how we perform arithmetic in the decimal system. The computer’s hardware is designed to interpret and execute these binary operations rapidly.\\\\
\textbf{Digitization and the Digital Revolution}\\
Digitization is the process of converting various forms of information (such as text, numbers, images, or music) into digital data that can be stored, processed, or transmitted by electronic devices. The \textbf{Digital Revolution} refers to the era in which digital devices have proliferated, becoming smaller, faster, and more affordable, leading to their widespread adoption in everyday life.\\
\textbf{The Binary System: 0s and 1s}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The binary system represents all data using only two digits: 0 and 1. These digits are called \textbf{binary digits}, or \textit{bits}.
	\item A \textbf{bit} is the basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. It represents a value of either 0 or 1.
	\item A \textbf{digital file} is a named collection of data stored on a physical medium such as a hard disk, CD, DVD, or flash drive. Files consist of sequences of bits.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{All the World’s a Bit-Pattern}\\\\
 Each bit pattern can have different interpretations depending on its context. One bit is the smallest piece of information and can have only two states: 0 or 1. However, by combining bits into groups, we can represent more complex data. For example, a bit pattern like \texttt{01001011} could have various interpretations depending on the context:
\begin{itemize}
	\item As a number: it could represent the number 75 (in decimal).
	\item As a letter: it could represent the letter ‘K’ in ASCII.
	\item As part of a picture: it could indicate how much green is needed at a particular pixel.
	\item As an instruction: it might be an instruction to subtract one from a register in a microcomputer.
\end{itemize}
Thus, the same bit pattern can mean many different things depending on how the computer and the programmer interpret it.\\\\
\textbf{Patterns of Bits: Grouping Bits Together}\\\\
The most compact way to represent a single bit is by writing it as either \texttt{0} or \texttt{1}. Larger data sets are represented as strings of bits, for example: \texttt{01101000} or \texttt{11010101}. These bit patterns can be of any length, and computers are typically designed to handle bits in fixed-size groups called \textbf{words}. The size of a word varies across different systems, and common word lengths are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 4 bits
	\item 8 bits (commonly called a \textbf{byte})
	\item 16 bits
	\item 32 bits
	\item 64 bits
\end{itemize}

\noindent For example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 8 bits = 1 byte
	\item 16 bits = 2 bytes = 1 short (or word)
	\item 32 bits = 4 bytes = 1 long
\end{itemize}
In most modern computers, data is grouped in multiples of 8 bits, but smaller systems (like microcontrollers) may use shorter word sizes, such as 4 bits (called a \textbf{nibble}). In practice, bit patterns are typically written in full bytes, even if only some of the bits are actually used.\\\\
\textbf{How to Distinguish Binary Patterns}\\\\
Since binary patterns can easily be confused with numbers, there are several ways to indicate that a value is in binary format. For example, the binary pattern \texttt{1101} can be written in different ways to show that it is a binary number:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{1101B}
	\item \texttt{0b1101}
	\item \texttt{1101\_2}
	\item \%1101
\end{itemize}
In this text, I will use the \texttt{0b} prefix to indicate binary numbers whenever there is potential for confusion.\\\\

\subsubsection{Bits and Bytes}
\textbf{Understanding Bits and Bytes}
In computing, data is represented in binary, which means it is expressed using only two symbols: 0 and 1. These binary digits are known as \textbf{bits}. Multiple bits can be grouped to form \textbf{bytes}, which are the basic unit of data used to represent characters and other information in computing.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Bit:} A \textbf{bit} is the smallest unit of data in a computer. It represents a binary digit, either 0 or 1.
	\item \textbf{Byte:} A \textbf{byte} consists of 8 bits. It is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Units of Digital Information}
The table below shows common units of digital information used in computing, their values, and common uses.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\caption{Units of Digital Information}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Unit}      & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Size (in Bits/Bytes)} \\ \hline
		\textbf{Bit}       & \texttt{b}      & 1 bit                         \\ \hline
		\textbf{Byte}      & \texttt{B}      & 8 bits (1 byte)               \\ \hline
		\textbf{Kilobit}   & \texttt{Kb}     & $1,024$ or $2^{10}$ bits      \\ \hline
		\textbf{Kilobyte}  & \texttt{KB}     & $1,024$ or $2^{10}$ bytes     \\ \hline

		\textbf{Exabyte}   & \texttt{EB}     & $2^{60}$ bytes                \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Bit and Byte Usage in Computing}

Bits and bytes serve different purposes in computer systems:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Bits} are used primarily to measure data transmission rates. For instance, internet connection speeds are often expressed in bits per second (bps).
	\item \textbf{Bytes} are used to represent data storage sizes, such as the size of files on your hard drive or the capacity of memory storage devices.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Common Usage Examples:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{56 Kbps:} Kilobit per second (Kbps) is often used to express slower data rates, such as a dial-up internet connection.
	\item \textbf{50 Mbps:} Megabit per second (Mbps) is used for faster data rates, such as broadband or fiber internet speeds.
	\item \textbf{104 KB:} Kilobyte (KB) is used to describe the size of smaller files, such as text documents.
	\item \textbf{3.2 MB:} Megabyte (MB) is commonly used for describing file sizes of photos, videos, and audio files.
	\item \textbf{100 Gbit:} Gigabit (Gb) is used for extremely fast network speeds, often seen in high-performance network connections.
	\item \textbf{16 GB:} Gigabyte (GB) is commonly used to refer to storage capacities in hard drives, USB flash drives, and memory cards.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Compression}

\textbf{What is Data Compression?}\\
Data compression is the process of reducing the size of digital data to save storage space or decrease transmission time over networks. By reducing the number of bits required to store or transmit information, compression allows for more efficient use of storage and faster data transfers.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Data compression} refers to any technique that recodes data in such a way that it contains fewer bits than the original format.
	\item Compression is commonly referred to as \textbf{zipping}, named after the popular ZIP compression format.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Benefits of Data Compression}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Reduces file size:} Compressed files take up less disk space, which allows users to store more data.
	\item \textbf{Faster transmission times:} Smaller file sizes reduce the time it takes to transfer files over a network or the internet.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Types of Data Compression}\\\\
Data compression techniques are generally divided into two main categories: \textbf{lossless} and \textbf{lossy} compression.\\\\
\textbf{1. Lossless Compression}\\\\
\textbf{Lossless compression} is a method of compressing data such that, when decompressed, the data is identical to the original. No data is lost during the compression process, making it ideal for text files, executable programs, and other sensitive data where accuracy is crucial.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Lossless compression ensures that uncompressed data is \textbf{exactly the same} as the original data.
	\item Examples of lossless compression formats include \texttt{ZIP}, \texttt{PNG}, and \texttt{GIF}.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
\textbf{2. Lossy Compression}\\\\
\textbf{Lossy compression} is a technique where some amount of data is discarded during the compression process. This is often used for media files like images, videos, and audio files, where perfect fidelity is not essential, and slight data loss is acceptable. As a result, the compressed file is significantly smaller, but the uncompressed version will not be identical to the original.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Lossy compression} removes some data that may not be noticeable to the human senses, making it ideal for multimedia files.
	\item Examples of lossy compression formats include \texttt{JPEG}, \texttt{MP3}, and \texttt{MP4}.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Compression Tools and Formats}\\\\
To perform compression, specialized software tools are used, often referred to as \textbf{compression utilities} or \textbf{zip tools}. These tools are integrated into most modern operating systems and are typically accessed via the file management interface.
\begin{itemize}
	\item On laptops and desktop computers, compression utilities are accessible through file explorer tools. 
	\item Popular compression software includes \texttt{WinRAR}, \texttt{7-Zip}, and \texttt{macOS Archive Utility}.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
\textbf{Common File Extensions for Compressed Files}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{.zip}: A common archive format for lossless compression.
	\item \texttt{.gz}: Gzip format, typically used in Unix/Linux systems.
	\item \texttt{.tar.gz}: A combination of the \texttt{tar} archiving format and \texttt{gzip} compression.
	\item \texttt{.pkg}: Commonly used in macOS for package management.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Extracting Compressed Files}\\\\
The process of returning a compressed file to its original state is called \textbf{extracting} or \textbf{unzipping}. Once extracted, the data will either be identical to the original (in the case of lossless compression) or slightly altered (in the case of lossy compression).\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Extracting or Unzipping:} Refers to the decompression process where compressed data is restored to its usable form.
	\item The original file format is restored when extraction is complete.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Number Representation and Bit Models}

In digital systems, all data—whether numbers, text, images, or other formats—must be stored and represented numerically. Essentially, every piece of information breaks down to sequences of ones and zeros (binary). Understanding how this data is stored and interpreted is essential for working with computers.

Consider the binary sequence:
\[
01000011 \ 01001111 \ 01010111
\]
This sequence can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context:
\begin{itemize}
	\item As three unique integers: \(67, 79, 87\)
	\item As a large number: \(4,411,223\)
	\item As a word: \texttt{COW}
	\item As a color (in RGB format)
\end{itemize}
Thus, how we interpret binary data depends on the application and context.

\textbf*{Number Systems}
Computers use several number systems to represent data, such as \textbf{Binary}, \textbf{Octal}, \textbf{Decimal}, and \textbf{Hexadecimal}. While humans typically use the decimal (base-10) system, computers prefer binary (base-2). Here's a comparison of these systems with examples:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Base} & \textbf{Number System} & \textbf{Allowed Digits} & \textbf{Example Number} \\
	\hline
	2 & \text{Binary} & 0, 1 & 1001011_2 \\
	8 & \text{Octal} & 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 113_8 \\
	10 & \text{Decimal} & 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 & 75_{10} \\
	16 & \text{Hexadecimal} & 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F & 4B_{16} \\
	\hline
\end{array}
\]

\textbf*{Example Conversions}
Let's consider the binary number \(1001101_2\). We'll calculate its decimal, octal, and hexadecimal values.

\textbf*{1. Binary to Decimal}
\[
1001101_2 = (1 \times 2^6) + (0 \times 2^5) + (0 \times 2^4) + (1 \times 2^3) + (1 \times 2^2) + (0 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0)
\]
\[
= 64 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 77_{10}
\]

\textbf*{2. Binary to Octal}
Group the binary number in sets of three bits, starting from the right:
\[
1001101_2 \rightarrow 001 \ 001 \ 101 = 1 \ 1 \ 5 = 115_8
\]

\textbf*{3. Binary to Hexadecimal}
Group the binary number in sets of four bits, starting from the right:
\[
1001101_2 \rightarrow 0100 \ 1101 = 4 \ D = 4D_{16}
\]

\textbf*{Base Conversion Table}
Here’s a comprehensive table showing the conversion of a binary number to decimal, octal, and hexadecimal, and vice versa. This table includes the first few numbers to help you understand the conversions better.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Binary} & \textbf{Decimal} & \textbf{Octal} & \textbf{Hexadecimal} \\
	\hline
	0000_2 & 0_{10} & 0_8 & 0_{16} \\
	0001_2 & 1_{10} & 1_8 & 1_{16} \\
	0010_2 & 2_{10} & 2_8 & 2_{16} \\
	0011_2 & 3_{10} & 3_8 & 3_{16} \\
	0100_2 & 4_{10} & 4_8 & 4_{16} \\
	0101_2 & 5_{10} & 5_8 & 5_{16} \\
	0110_2 & 6_{10} & 6_8 & 6_{16} \\
	0111_2 & 7_{10} & 7_8 & 7_{16} \\
	1000_2 & 8_{10} & 10_8 & 8_{16} \\
	1001_2 & 9_{10} & 11_8 & 9_{16} \\
	1010_2 & 10_{10} & 12_8 & A_{16} \\
	1011_2 & 11_{10} & 13_8 & B_{16} \\
	1100_2 & 12_{10} & 14_8 & C_{16} \\
	1101_2 & 13_{10} & 15_8 & D_{16} \\
	1110_2 & 14_{10} & 16_8 & E_{16} \\
	1111_2 & 15_{10} & 17_8 & F_{16} \\
	\hline
\end{array}
\]

\textbf*{Conversions Between Number Systems}

\textbf*{1. Binary to Decimal}
To convert a binary number to decimal, use the following formula:
\[
\text{Decimal Value} = (b_n \times 2^n) + (b_{n-1} \times 2^{n-1}) + \cdots + (b_1 \times 2^1) + (b_0 \times 2^0)
\]
Where \(b_i\) represents each binary digit.

\textbf*{2. Decimal to Binary}
To convert decimal to binary, repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and note the remainders. The binary equivalent is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse.

\textbf*{3. Hexadecimal to Binary}
Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to exactly four binary digits. For example:
\[
A_{16} = 1010_2, \quad B_{16} = 1011_2
\]
So, converting \(0x4B_{16}\) to binary gives:
\[
4B_{16} = 0100 \ 1011_2 = 1001011_2
\]

\textbf*{4. Octal to Binary}
Each octal digit corresponds to three binary digits. For example:
\[
7_8 = 111_2, \quad 3_8 = 011_2
\]

\textbf*{Example in C (Number Representation)}

The following C code demonstrates how different base values can be represented in C:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
	#include <stdio.h>
	int main() {
		unsigned char dec = 27;    // Decimal: 27
		unsigned char oct = 027;   // Octal: 023 (decimal: 23)
		unsigned char hex = 0xbf;  // Hexadecimal: 0xbf (decimal: 191)
		unsigned int hex2 = 0xbad; // Hexadecimal: 0xbad (decimal: 2989)
		unsigned char bin = 0b00111100; // Binary: 60 in decimal
		
		printf("%d %d %d %d %d\n", dec, oct, hex, hex2, bin);
		return 0;
	}
\end{lstlisting}

This program outputs the decimal equivalents of different base representations.

\subsubsection{ELEMENTS OF	INFORMATION THEORY}

\subsubsection{Shannon's Entropy and Information Content}
Shannon's entropy is a fundamental concept in information theory that quantifies the uncertainty or unpredictability in data. It is a measure of the information content in a message and helps in understanding how much data can be compressed. This subsection explains how entropy relates to data transmission, compression, and the efficient encoding of information.

\subsubsection{Noise, Redundancy, and Compression in Data}
In communication systems, noise refers to random disturbances that can alter data during transmission. Redundancy is often added to data to counteract noise and improve accuracy. Compression techniques reduce the amount of data by eliminating unnecessary redundancy. This subsection covers how these concepts affect the integrity and efficiency of data in communication channels.

\subsubsection{Data Transmission and Loss in Communication Systems}
Data loss can occur due to various factors such as noise or interruptions in communication systems. This subsection examines how data is transmitted across networks and the mechanisms used to detect and correct errors, ensuring that the transmitted data remains intact.
